The beginning of a set of maps for teaching the second world war. 

Maps for the Atlantic area in 1940, the European and North African area at the end of 1940, and the Pacific area in 1941 appear in their respective subfolders, with a knittable RMarkdown file for RStudio and geojson data together with a .csv file for additional variables.

If you want just the maps, they're in the "justmaps" folder.

These maps were made with R, using ggplot and sf, and with some use of QGIS where necessary; other specific debts are noted in the map files themselves.

With special thanks to Kieran Healy, Sarah Bagby, Steve Cook, and Sam Anthony, as well as Jason Heppler for kindly agreeing to demonstrate replicability of code.
