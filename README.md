The beginning of a set of maps for teaching the second world war. Map data draws principally from [Natural Earth datasets](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/), at various resolutions. I've drawn for reference on other sources, including [Andr√© Ourednik's historical basemaps](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps) repository. For colors I drew mainly from [CARTOcolors](https://carto.com/carto-colors/). When all else has failed I've looked up latitudes and longitudes in Wikipedia.
