Map data draws principally from [Natural Earth datasets](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/), at various resolutions. I've drawn for reference on other sources, including [André Ourednik's historical basemaps](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps) repository; for occupied China, I relied on Greg Huff, [_World War II and Southeast Asia_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/world-war-ii-and-southeast-asia/5EE13B3424DE481C5AD6E1B82D0058D2). For colors I drew mainly from [CARTOcolors](https://carto.com/carto-colors/). When all else has failed I've looked up latitudes and longitudes in Wikipedia. Made with R, including ggplot and sf, as well as some use of QGIS. With gratitude especially to Kieran Healy.
